📁 Google Drive File System Simulation (C++)
This project is a console-based simulation of a Google Drive File Management System, developed as part of the Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) course at FAST University. It replicates essential cloud file operations, user management, directory structures, and file sharing, using custom-implemented data structures in C++, without STL containers.

🚀 Key Features
🔐 User Authentication & Roles
Role-based access control (Admin 🛡️, Editor ✏️, Viewer 👀) with secure login & account recovery.

📄 File Operations
Create 🆕, Read 📖, Update ✏️, Delete 🗑️ files with RLE Compression for storage optimization.

🕑 Version Control
Maintain file history and perform rollback to previous versions.

🗑️ Recycle Bin (Stack-based)
Recover deleted files via a stack mechanism.

🕒 Recent Files (Queue-based)
Track and display the five most recently accessed files.

📂 Directory Management (Tree-based)
Organize files into a hierarchical folder structure.

☁️ Cloud Sync Simulation (Queue)
Queue-based syncing mechanism simulating cloud upload operations.

🤝 File Sharing Access (Graph BFS Traversal)
Share files with other users and validate access paths using BFS traversal in a user-sharing graph.

💾 Persistent Storage
User data and file metadata are stored in .txt files to ensure session persistence.

⚡ Custom Hash Table
Efficient file lookup through a custom hash table implementation for optimized access.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Language: C++ (without STL containers)

Data Structures: Tree 🌳, Hash Table #️⃣, Stack 🗂️, Queue 📋, Graph 🔗, Linked List ➿

File I/O: Text-based persistence

Console UI: Color-coded terminal interface for improved UX

🎯 Project Objective
This simulation aims to demonstrate the application of data structures in system design by building a scalable file management system that mimics the core functionalities of cloud platforms like Google Drive. The focus is on algorithmic implementations, not GUI or real cloud integrations, to strengthen foundational understanding of DSA concepts.
